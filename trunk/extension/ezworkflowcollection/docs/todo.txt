multipublish workflow:
- use graphical node selector to pick target nodes of multipublication

subtree mutiplexer workflow:
- use graphical node selector to pick target nodes
- allow more than one subtree to be selected at a time

workflows that could be useful:

- another multiplexer: filter on class/attribute

- the same as the multiplexers, but used as filters on the existing workflow rather than jump-off points

- add_to_obj_relation
- add_to_obj_relation(s)_attribute
- demultipublish (the opposite of multipublish)

- hide_until_date (same as wait_until_date but keeps obj invisibles) => use gwutils extension
- copy object
- set_section
- something about translating content... ?
- change_owner
- ...
- profit!
